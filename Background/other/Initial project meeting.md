- Latino population in Pueblo, CO have high prevalence of vaping
- n = 20 or so, 6 who vape, hoping eventually for 30
- Data is currently preliminary
- IOS is another lung function measurement, like FEV1 or FVC
- Age + gender adjusted exposure + outcome

This project: 
- Cluster exposures (vaping characteristics) present among those with "high" (bad) ios
- Produce plot of exposures by vaping status, then pick out outliers in the ios values for vapers
