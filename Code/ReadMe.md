This folder contains all the code. Within each of the sub-folders, files are numbered in the order that they should be run to recreate the analysis. Please note that some code is found *within* the .RMD documents used to create the reports. Some code files were sun as side-projects or attempts to try different methodology. Files that are not needed to recreate the final analysis are marked as "*_deprecated.R". To recreate any analysis, please run files in the order that they are numbered. Markdown reports reference outputs of these documents.
