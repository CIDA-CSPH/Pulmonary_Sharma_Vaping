# Introduction

The breakdown of study participants shows that 12 of the 13 (92%) of vapers recruited for this study were from the Pueblo recruitment center. Overall, 21 subjects (42%) were recruited at the Pueblo center. The purpose of this report is to look at an analysis of only the participants recruited from the Pueblo center and compare it to the overall model containing all study participants to assess differences in estimates and significant gene composition between the models. 

# Methods

To assess the difference in model outputs, the following model was fit in DESeq2 ver. `r package.version("DESeq2")` with all of the recruited subjects and again with only the subjects from the Pueblo recruitment center. Likelihood Ratio Tests (LRTs) were implemented to test for gene significance and corrected with FDR $\le$ 0.05. For the purpose of this report, the model containing all subjects will be referred to as *Model A* and the model with only participants from the Pueblo recruitment center will be referred to as *Model P*.

$$Full \ Model \\ raw \ read \ count \sim vape \ status + recruitment \ center + sex + age + ruv_1 + ruv_2$$

$$Reduced \ Model \ (Vape \ Status) \\ raw \ read \ count \sim recruitment \ center + sex + age + ruv_1 + ruv_2$$

When fitting the model for only the subjects recruited in Pueblo, the *recruitment center* covariate is held constant, and therefore, not included in the model. Each of these models will test if *vape status* contributes significantly to gene expression.  

To assess the difference in the models, the results will focus on genes with relatively low variability. To achieve a stable subset, a cutoff value of |Log~2~(Fold-Change)| > 2 will be used (see "sample12_sensitivity_report" for details). This report will present:\
<br/>

1.  A Venn Diagram summarizing the top 100 genes in each model and all genes.\
    <br/>
2.  Visualizations comparing |Log~2~(Fold-Change)| estimates and p-values between the two models.\
    <br/>
3.  A short table for the top 10 genes and their estimates in both models.

# Results

The top 100 genes determined by FDR were subset from Model A to compare to Model P. This comparison shows that the top 100 genes in Model A are identical to the top 100 genes in Model P.

### Figure 1: Total Significant Genes in Models A & B

The top 100 significant genes in models A & P are identical both before and after the selected cutoff value (|Log~2~(Fold-Change)| > 2). A Venn Diagram of these would be trivial (a single circle), so Figure 2 shows the breakdown of the significant genes in Models A and P.

```{r}

  dplyr::select(Gene, Gene_Name, Gene_Type, Estimate_A, Estimate_B, Estimate_Difference, Estimate_P_Difference, FDR_A, FDR_B) %>% 
  mutate(FDR_A = if_else(FDR_A < 0.001, "< 0.001", as.character(round(FDR_A,3))),
         FDR_B = if_else(FDR_B < 0.001, "< 0.001", as.character(round(FDR_B,3))),
         Gene = gsub("\\..*", "", Gene)) %>% 
  dplyr::rename("Ensemble ID" = Gene,
                "Gene Name" = Gene_Name,
                "Gene Type" = Gene_Type,
                "Log~2~(FC) (Mod A)" = Estimate_A,
                "Log~2~(FC) (Mod B)" = Estimate_B,
                "Log~2~(FC) Difference (B - A)" = Estimate_Difference,
                "Log~2~(FC) Difference (%)" = Estimate_P_Difference,
                "FDR (Mod A)" = FDR_A,
                "FDR (Mod B)" = FDR_B) %>%
  kablize(.,digits = 3)
```
These results demonstrate that estimates increase when looking only at subjects from Pueblo. That effect does not make a large difference in the number of significant genes or the direction of their effect.  

### Figure 3: Difference in Log~2~(Fold-Change) (Top 2000 Genes)
Figure 3 parallels Plot A in Figure 3, but includes the top 2000 genes to visualize this trend.
```{r}
#Get the top 2000 genes
top_1000 <- AB_res_no_cutoff[1:2000,]

#Scatter Plot
change_scatter <- top_1000 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Estimate_A, y = Estimate_B)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(aes(intercept = 0, slope = 1, col = "Equal Estimates"), linetype = 2, col = 'red')+
  labs(x = "Log2(FC) (Model A)",
       y = "Log2(FC) (Model P)") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-10,10,2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-10,10,2)) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Guides", values = c("Equal Log2(FC)" = "red"))
change_scatter
```

There is a small amount of variability present in the estimates; however, a majority of the estimates are clustered around the line representing equal estimates. 

### Figure 4: -log~10~(p-value) Model A vs. Model P

Figure 4 similarly visualizes the trend by plotting -log~10~(p-value) for each of the models plotted against each other.
```{r}
top_1000 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = -log10(FDR_A), y = -log10(FDR_B))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(aes(intercept = 0, slope = 1, col = 'Equal P-values'), linetype = 2)+
  scale_color_manual(name = "Guides", values = c("Equal P-values" = "red")) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,40,10)) +
  labs(x = "-log10(p-value A)",
       y = "-log10(p-value P)")
```

Excluding subjects that are not from Pueblo from the model additionally inflates p-values. P-values are already very small, so a small increase in p-values does not change the overall composition of significant genes.

# Conclusion

When looking at only the top 100 genes as determined by FDR-adjusted P-values, all genes retain significance from Model A to Model P. From the series of visualizations presented in the report, excluding subjects from recruitment centers other than Pueblo decreases |Log~2~(Fold-Change)| estimates, but does not significantly change the composition of significantly expressed genes. Looking at at a larger subset of the top genes confirms that estimates are decreased overall when excluding subjects not recruited at the Pueblo center. Since excluding those samples does not change the composition or direction of |Log~2~(Fold-Change)| estimates, further analyses will include all (n = 47) subjects.
